# Networking Projects 🧠🌐

This repository contains a collection of Python projects designed to demonstrate core networking concepts and protocols.

## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 [TCP Handshake Simulator](tcp_handshake_simulator/)
Simulates a 3-way TCP handshake in the CLI to visualize connection setup between a client and server.

### 🔹 [BGP Route Selector](bgp_route_selector/)
Implements simplified BGP route decision logic using AS path lengths.

### 🔹 [Packet Log Analyzer](packet_log_analyzer/)
Parses and analyzes sample tcpdump logs to identify packet flow and anomalies.

## 🧠 Goal

To deepen understanding of TCP/IP, BGP, and real-world network diagnostics — and to showcase hands-on skills for network-focused roles.
